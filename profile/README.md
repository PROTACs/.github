# PROTACs

Welcome to the PROTACs organization! Our goal is to advance computational approaches for PROTAC (Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras) drug discovery. We focus on leveraging cutting-edge data, innovative models, and in-depth research to explore the potential of PROTACs in therapeutic applications.

### Key Areas:
- **Data**: Curating high-quality datasets for PROTAC drug development.
- **Modeling**: Developing models to optimize PROTAC design, assess efficacy, and explore novel drug candidates.
- **Research**: Conducting studies to uncover new pathways and strategies for PROTAC-based therapies.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to push the boundaries of PROTAC drug discovery.
